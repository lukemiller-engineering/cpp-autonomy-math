\## Contents


* "rotate_vector_z.cpp"

 - Rotate a 3D vector around the Z-axis using a rotation matrix and trigonometric functions.


* "matrix_multiply.cpp"

 - Multiply two matrices using nested vectors.

* "Cluster.cpp"

 - Clusters a group of points within a distance. 

* "CountIsolated.cpp"
 - Counts isolated numbers.

* "PID.cpp"
 - Demonstrates real-time position tracking using a simple PID loop. Outputs time, position, and control command.

(Additional examples coming soon...)
